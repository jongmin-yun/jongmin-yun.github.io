# jongmin-yun.github.io
I'm trying to publish my blog via this github.

* I'm not used to do this now but I'll make it.
  * I learned markdown via this link ([GIST_github, Korean website](https://gist.github.com/ihoneymon/652be052a0727ad59601))

## Tasks
* [x] make a github page ([Official github pages instruction](https://pages.github.com/))
* [ ] Install the Ruby Jekyll ([Korean explanation](https://gmlwjd9405.github.io/2017/10/06/Jekyll-github.io-blog-1.html))
* Jekyll theme has been chosen in 'Setting' menu in the current git hub repository. This is an official [Link](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser/) to explanation for the process.
* [ ] learning how to use github itself ([Korean explanation](https://backlog.com/git-tutorial/kr/intro/intro4_2.html))
