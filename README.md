I'm trying to publish my blog via this github.

* I'm not used to do this now but I'll make it.
  * I learned markdown via this link [GIST_github](https://gist.github.com/ihoneymon/652be052a0727ad59601)

## Tasks
* [x] make a github page
* [ ] Install the Ruby Jekyll ([Korean explanation](https://gmlwjd9405.github.io/2017/10/06/Jekyll-github.io-blog-1.html))
* [ ] learning how to use github itself
